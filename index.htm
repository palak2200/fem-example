        <p>        Regardless of everything that came your way and all the times I’ve let you
            down, you’ve shown me nothing but unconditional love. It was this love
            that led to the sacrifices that you made, and it was this love that kept me
            smiling. You forgave, you hugged, you laughed, you inspired, you
            encouraged, you healed, and you did everything else in your power to
            demonstrate that with love, anything was possible. Which is why I’m here
            today, passing on my love to others, through my words.</p>
